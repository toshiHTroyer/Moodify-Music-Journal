## **Note:** 
This was a group project completed for a Software Engineering course.
I specifically developed the mood-to-song algorithm and the playlist creation functionality, integrating the Spotify API to personalize user experiences based on selected moods.

## **Product Description**
**Moodify** is a web-based platform designed to help users track their moods through journal entries and explore music that matches or enhances their emotional state. With the ability to search for songs via the Spotify API, add moods to entries, and visualize mood fluctuations through interactive graphs, Moodify combines self-reflection with music discovery. Users can also create playlists based on their moods, listen to songs to ensure they are the right fit, and manage their journal entries over time.

## **System Setup and Configuration**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2024/5-final-codetarts.git
cd 5-final-codetarts
```

---

### **2. Create the `.env` File**
To run the application, create a `.env` file in the back-end directory with the following structure:

```env
# Flask Configuration
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_PORT=5001

# Spotify API Keys
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Database Configuration
MONGO_DBNAME=your_db_name_here
MONGO_URI='mongodb+srv://example:example@example.2h0hc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=example'

# Secret Key
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

Replace the placeholders (`your_secret_key_here`, `your_client_id_here`, etc.) with your actual credentials.
